### Computer Graphics ITMO labs

Requires `TASM.EXE` and `TLINK.exe` in the `tools` directory. 
It's recommended to use `TurboDebugger`.

To compile & link labwork in `dosbox`:
```
    mount c \path\to\computer-graphics\repository
    c:
    MAKE.bat [labwork_index]
```
You can add this lines to your `.dosbox.conf` to make dosbox execute it automatically on each startup.
